## Getting Started

### 1. Install Git and Node.js
Before you can run the project, you need to install Git and Node.js. You can download them from the following links:
- Install Git following GitHub's guide at https://github.com/git-guides/install-git  
- Install the latest LTS Version of Node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/download/
### 2. Clone the repository
Once you have installed both Git and Node.js: 
- Open the folder where you want to store the repository (e.g. D:\Repos)
- Open PowerShell in that folder (Shift + Right Click -> Open PowerShell window here)
- Clone the repository by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/misar-naeem/StudyGroup.git
```
### 3. Install dependencies and run the project
Now that you have cloned the repository, you need to install the dependencies. To do so, open the `StudyGroup` folder in PowerShell (Shift + Right Click -> Open PowerShell window here) and run the following command:
```
npm ci
```
After the dependencies have been installed, you can run the project by running the following command:
```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
